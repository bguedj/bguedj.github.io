								Abstract
							</h2>
							<p>
								PAC-Bayesian inequalities were introduced by McAllester (<a href="">1998</a>, <a href="">1999</a>), following earlier remarks by <a href="">Shawe-Taylor and Williamson (1997)</a>. The goal was to produce PAC-type risk bounds for Bayesian-flavored estimators. The acronym PAC stands for Probably Approximately Correct and may be traced back to <a href="">Valiant (1984)</a>. This framework allows to consider not only classical Bayesian estimators, but rather any randomized procedure from a data-dependent distribution.</p>
								<p>
									Over the past few years, the PAC-Bayesian approach has been applied to numerous settings, including classification, high-dimensional sparse regression, image denoising and reconstruction of large random matrices, recommendation systems and collaborative filtering, binary ranking, online ranking, transfer learning, multiview learning, signal processing, physics, to name but a few.

									The <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/?query=PAC-Bayes&searchtype=all&source=header">"PAC-Bayes"</a> query on arXiv illustrates how PAC-Bayes is quickly re-emerging as a principled theory to efficiently address modern machine learning topics, such as leaning with heavy-tailed and dependent data, or deep neural networks generalisation abilities.
								</p>
								<h2>
									Topics
								</h2>
								<p>
									The tutorial aims at providing the ICML audience with a comprehensive overview of PAC-Bayes, starting from statistical learning theory (complexity terms analysis, generalisation and oracle bounds) and covering algorithmic (actual implementation of PAC-Bayesian algorithms) developments, up to the most recent PAC-Bayesian analyses of deep neural networks generalisation abilities. The PAC-Bayesian framework is the backbone to several influential contributions to statistical learning theory and deep learning and we believe it is time to address again this theory in a full tutorial. We intend to address the largest audience, with an elementary background in probability theory and statistical learning, although all key concepts will be covered from scratch.

								Benjamin Guedj has recently uploaded on arXiv a survey on PAC-Bayesian learning which is the backbone to this tutorial proposal \citep{guedj2019primer}\footnote{\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05353}{https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05353}}. Benjamin Guedj has given more than 40 talks on PAC-Bayesian learning since 2011, in seminars, workshop and international conferences (for more details, see \href{https://www.dropbox.com/s/en9antsq9wxi3ka/CV-BGuedj.pdf?dl=0}{his resume}). In particular, he has recently given a one hour tutorial on PAC-Bayesian learning at the \href{https://sites.google.com/view/bigworkshop/home}{2nd Italian-French Statistics Seminar} (IFSS2018), in September 2018. The slides are fairly representative of some of the content which would be addressed by the tutorial.

								\medskip

								Benjamin Guedj has organized (with Francis Bach and Pascal Germain) a NIPS 2017 workshop on PAC-Bayesian learning, called \href{https://bguedj.github.io/nips2017/50shadesbayesian.html}{(Almost) 50 Shades of Bayesian Learning: PAC-Bayesian trends and insights}. In particular, several talks addressed the promising connection between PAC-Bayes and deep neural networks, and the one hour tutorial by François Laviolette also gives a glance at the material which would be covered by the present tutorial proposal. John Shawe-Taylor was one of the plenary speakers of the workshop and his talk also covers relevant material to this tutorial proposal.

								Last but not least, John Shawe-Taylor gave an invited tutorial at NeurIPS 2018 (together with Omar Rivasplata), on statistical learning theory. The content of this tutorial is also extremely relevant to this proposal.
