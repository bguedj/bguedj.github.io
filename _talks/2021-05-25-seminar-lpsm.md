I gave a talk at the [LPSM](https://www.lpsm.paris) Seminar -- certainly the one talk (out of many I gave since the pandemic) I wish I could have delivered in person, as this is the lab where I did my MSc and PhD (a while ago)! You can access the [slides](https://bguedj.github.io/files/bguedj-talk-2021-lpsm.pdf).
