I gave a talk at CogX 2020 as part of the workshops organised by the UCL Centre for Artificial Intelligence. You can access the [slides](https://bguedj.github.io/files/bguedj-talk-2020-cogx.pdf).

The [initial video recording](https://youtu.be/sh9-J33jlHU) suffered from several technical glitches (sound is parasited and video goes missing in some parts). Here is a [much better recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ol84OMWfGc).
