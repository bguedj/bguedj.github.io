I co-organised with [Séverine Trouillet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/séverine-trouillet/) a workshop at the British Embassy in Paris, entitled "Women and STEM: Shaping the Future in AI and Education", and served as moderator to the discussion. This was part of a series of workshops organised via the [Franco-British Data Society](https://www.francobritishdatasociety.org/en/home/), of which I am a director.
