<h2>Deadlines for AI/ML conferences</h2>

I used to maintain locally a clumsy spreadsheet to keep track of deadlines for AI/ML conferences. Now I'm using this and it's much nicer: <a href="https://bguedj.github.io/ai-deadlines/">https://bguedj.github.io/ai-deadlines</a>

<h2>Translator</h2>

I mainly use [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) for quick translation. Success story from 2018: with a bunch of colleagues from France, we translated the book ["Deep Learning"](http://www.deeplearningbook.org) by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville to French in a couple months: introducing [l'Apprentissage profond](https://www.apprentissageprofond.org). Our secret? Scripts to massively accelerate translation with [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator).

<h2>Character counter</h2>

Whevener writing up grant proposals or rebuttals, I end up a lot on <a href="https://charactercounttool.com">this website</a>. Here's a handy embedded version for quick access.
