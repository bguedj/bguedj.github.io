## Topics

TBC

My research lies in statistical learning theory and machine learning and I mainly submit my papers to statistics journals and ma- chine learning conferences. I have always been careful to preserve a balance between theoretical research, design and implemen- tation of algorithms, and impact through collaborations with companies. Since 2010, I have focused on the following themes.
