Welcome to my corner of the web!

I am a **Principal Research Fellow** in machine learning at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk) ([Centre for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/), [Department of Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/)) and a **tenured research scientist** at [Inria](http://www.inria.fr/) (affiliated with the [Modal research team](https://team.inria.fr/modal/) from the [Lille - Nord Europe research centre](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-lille-nord-europe)). I am also a **visiting researcher** at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk).

## Bio

TBC

<!-- I obtained a Ph.D. in mathematics in 2013 from [UPMC](http://www.upmc.fr/) (Université Pierre & Marie Curie, France) under the supervision of [Gérard Biau](http://www.lsta.upmc.fr/biau.html) and [Éric Moulines](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=_XE1LvQAAAAJ&hl=fr). Prior to that, I was a research assistant at [DTU Compute](http://www.compute.dtu.dk/) (Denmark) supervised by [Gilles Guillot](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/~gigu/#).
 -->

<!-- My main line of research is in statistical machine learning. I am primarily interested in the design, analysis and implementation of statistical learning methods for high dimensional problems. My interests include (but are not limited to): PAC-Bayesian theory, sparsity and high-dimensional statistics, optimisation theory, statistical learning theory, non-negative matrix factorisation, aggregation of estimators and classifiers, MCMC algorithms, (un)supervised learning, online clustering, concentration inequalities... -->
