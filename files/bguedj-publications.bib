We first extend the PAC-Bayesian theory to the high dimensional paradigm in the additive and logistic regression settings. We prove that our estimators are nearly minimax optimal, and we provide an MCMC implementation, backed up by numerical simulations. Next, we introduce an original nonlinear aggregation strategy. Its theoretical merits are presented, and we benchmark the method—called COBRA—on a lengthy series of numerical experiments. Finally, a Bayesian approach to model admixture in population genetics is presented, along with its MCMC implementation.

Instead of building a linear or convex optimized combination over a collection of basic estimators $r_1,\dots,r_M$, we use them as a collective indicator of the proximity between the training data and a test observation. This local distance approach is model-free and very fast. More specifically, the resulting nonparametric/nonlinear combined estimator is shown to perform asymptotically at least as well in the $L^2$
sense as the best combination of the basic estimators in the collective. A companion R package called COBRA (standing for COmBined Regression Alternative) is presented (downloadable on http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/COBRA/index.html). Substantial numerical evidence is provided on both synthetic and real data sets to assess the excellent performance and velocity of our method in a large variety of prediction problems.",

This strategy relies on two main ingredients: the new notion of $L^q$ stability, and the strong use of moment inequalities. $L^q$ stability extends the ongoing notion of hypothesis stability while remaining weaker than the uniform stability. It leads to new PAC exponential generalisation bounds for Leave-one-Out under mild assumptions. In the literature, such bounds are available only for uniform stable algorithms under boundedness for instance. Our generic strategy is applied to the Ridge regression algorithm as a first step.",

abstract = "PAC-Bayesian learning bounds are of the utmost interest to the learning community. Their role is to connect the generalization ability of an aggregation distribution $\rho$ to its empirical risk and to its Kullback-Leibler divergence with respect to some prior distribution $\pi$. Unfortunately, most of the available bounds typically rely on heavy assumptions such as boundedness and independence of the observations. This paper aims at relaxing these constraints and provides PAC-Bayesian learning bounds that hold for dependent, heavy-tailed observations (hereafter referred to as \emph{hostile data}). In these bounds the Kullack-Leibler divergence is replaced with a general version of Csiszár’s f-divergence. We prove a general PAC-Bayesian bound, and show how to use it in various hostile settings.",

MV mutates training data labels, retrains the model against the mutated data, and then uses the metamorphic relation that captures the consequent training performance changes to assess model fit. It does not use a validation set or test set. The intuition underpinning MV is that overfitting models tend to fit noise in the training data. MV does not aim to replace out-of-sample validation. Instead, we provide the first exploratory study on the possibility of using MV as a complement of out-of-sample validation. We explore 8 different learning algorithms, 18 datasets, and 5 types of hyperparameter tuning tasks. Our results demonstrate that MV complements well cross-validation and test accuracy in model selection and hyperparameter tuning tasks. MV deserves more attention from developers when simplicity, sustainaiblity, security (e.g., defending training data attack), and interpretability of the built models are required.},

Our new bound consistently beats state-of-the-art bounds both on a toy example and on UCI datasets (with large enough $n$). Theoretically, unlike existing bounds, our new bound can be expected to converge to $0$ faster whenever a Bernstein/Tsybakov condition holds, thus connecting PAC-Bayesian generalization and {\em excess risk\/} bounds---for the latter it has long been known that faster convergence can be obtained under Bernstein conditions. Our main technical tool is a new concentration inequality which is like Bernstein's but with $X^2$ taken outside its expectation.",

abstract = 	 {We study the problem of learning a clustering of an online set of points. The specific formulation we use is the k-means objective: At each time step the algorithm has to maintain a set of k candidate centers and the loss incurred by the algorithm is the squared distance between the new point and the closest center. The goal is to minimize regret with respect to the best solution to the k-means objective in hindsight. We show that provided the data lies in a bounded region, learning is possible, namely an implementation of the Multiplicative Weights Update Algorithm (MWUA) using a discretized grid achieves a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ in expectation. We also present an online-to-offline reduction that shows that an efficient no-regret online algorithm (despite being allowed to choose a different set of candidate centres at each round) implies an offline efficient algorithm for the k-means problem, which is known to be NP-hard. In light of this hardness, we consider the slightly weaker requirement of comparing regret with respect to $(1 + \epsilon)OPT$ and present a no-regret algorithm with runtime $O\left(T \mathrm{poly}(\log(T),k,d,1/\epsilon)^{O(kd)}\right)$. Our algorithm is based on maintaining a set of points of bounded size which is a coreset that helps identifying the \emph{relevant} regions of the space for running an adaptive, more efficient, variant of the MWUA. We show that simpler online algorithms, such as \emph{Follow The Leader} (FTL), fail to produce sublinear regret in the worst case. We also report preliminary experiments with synthetic and real-world data. Our theoretical results answer an open question of Dasgupta (2008).},

Some models are “expensive” (strong assumptions, such as sub-Gaussian tails), others are “cheap” (simply finite variance). As it is well known, the more you pay, the more you get: in other words, the most expensive models yield the more interesting bounds. Recent advances in robust statistics have investigated procedures to obtain tight bounds while keeping the cost of assumptions minimal. The present paper explores and exhibits what the limits are for obtaining tight probably approximately correct (PAC)-Bayes bounds in a robust setting for cheap models.},

abstract = "Aircraft performance models play a key role in airline operations, especially in planning a fuel-efficient flight. In practice, manufacturers provide guidelines calibrated on one single aircraft, with performance modelling for all similar aircrafts (\emph{i.e.} same model) relying solely on that. In particular, it may poorly reflect on the current performance of a given aircraft. However, for each aircraft, flight data are continuously recorded and as such, not used to improve on the existing models. The key contribution of the present article is to foster the use of machine learning to leverage the massive amounts of collected data and update the models to reflect the actual performance of the aircraft. We illustrate our approach by focusing on the estimation of the drag and lift coefficients from recorded flight data. As these coefficients are not directly recorded, we resort to aerodynamics approximations. As a safety check, we provide bounds to assess the accuracy of both the aerodynamics approximation and the statistical performance of our approach. We provide numerical results on a collection of machine learning algorithms. We report excellent accuracy on real-life data and exhibit empirical evidence to support our modelling, in coherence with aerodynamics principles.",

We introduce KernelCobra, a non-linear learning strategy for combining an arbitrary number of initial predictors. KernelCobra builds on the COBRA algorithm introduced by Biau et al.

While the COBRA algorithm used a binary threshold to declare which training data were close and to be used, we generalise this idea by using a kernel to better encapsulate the proximity information. Such a smoothing kernel provides more representative weights to each of the training points which are used to build the aggregate and final predictor, and KernelCobra systematically outperforms the COBRA algorithm. While COBRA is intended for regression, KernelCobra deals with classification and regression. KernelCobra is included as part of the open source Python package Pycobra (0.2.4 and onward), introduced by Srinivasa Desikan (2018). Numerical experiments were undertaken to assess the performance (in terms of pure prediction and computational complexity) of KernelCobra on real-life and synthetic datasets.},

Building on earlier results, we provide a closed-form expression for the average opinion of the group at equilibrium. This leads us to a strategy to inject zealots into a polarised network in order to shift the average opinion towards any target value. We account for the possible presence of a backfire effect, which may lead the group to react negatively and reinforce its level of polarisation in response.

Widely used in mathematical finance, it is garnering increasing interest in machine learning, e.g., as an alternate approach to regularization, and as a means for ensuring fairness. This paper presents a generalization bound for learning algorithms that minimize the CVaR of the empirical loss. The bound is of PAC-Bayesian type and is guaranteed to be small when the empirical CVaR is small. We achieve this by reducing the problem of estimating CVaR to that of merely estimating an expectation. This then enables us, as a by-product, to obtain concentration inequalities for CVaR even when the random variable in question is unbounded.},

Unlike previous approaches in the literature, the model fully accounts for uncertainty and can handle irregular grids of observations while maintaining explicit formulations, by modelling the mean process in a unified GP framework. Predictive analytical equations are provided, integrating information shared across tasks through a relevant prior mean. This approach greatly improves the predictive performances, even far from observations, and may reduce significantly the computational complexity compared to traditional multi-task GP models.

In view of this, we leverage data-driven approaches to design a new end-to-end framework which is dynamics-free for optimized and realistic trajectories. Trajectories are here decomposed on function basis, trading the initial infinite dimension problem on a multivariate functional space for a parameter optimization problem. Then a maximum a posteriori approach which incorporates information from data is used to obtain a new penalized optimization problem. The penalized term narrows the search on a region centered on data and includes estimated features of the problem. We apply our data-driven approach to two settings in aeronautics and sailing routes optimization. The developed approach is implemented in the Python library PyRotor.},

Two bounds are for fixed estimators, and two are for randomized estimators through the PAC-Bayes theory. We control how much information is captured by kernel PCA on average, and we dissect the bounds to highlight strengths and limitations of the kernel PCA algorithm. Therefore, we contribute to the better understanding of kernel PCA. Our bounds are briefly illustrated on a toy numerical example.},

This combination has been shown to lead not only to accurate classifiers, but also to remarkably tight risk certificates, bearing promise towards self-certified learning (i.e. use all the data to learn a predictor and certify its quality). In this work, we empirically investigate the role of the prior. We experiment on 6 datasets with different strategies and amounts of data to learn data-dependent PAC-Bayes priors, and we compare them in terms of their effect on test performance of the learnt predictors and tightness of their risk certificate. We ask what is the optimal amount of data which should be allocated for building the prior and show that the optimum may be dataset dependent. We demonstrate that using a small percentage of the prior-building data for validation of the prior leads to promising results. We include a comparison of underparameterised and overparameterised models, along with an empirical study of different training objectives and regularisation strategies to learn the prior distribution.},

year={2023},
journal = {Journal of Machine Learning Research [JMLR]},
abstract = {We propose two novel nonparametric two-sample kernel tests based on the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). First, for a fixed kernel, we construct an MMD test using either permutations or a wild bootstrap, two popular numerical procedures to determine the test threshold. We prove that this test controls the probability of type I error non-asymptotically. Hence, it can be used reliably even in settings with small sample sizes as it remains well-calibrated, which differs from previous MMD tests which only guarantee correct test level asymptotically. When the difference in densities lies in a Sobolev ball, we prove minimax optimality of our MMD test with a specific kernel depending on the smoothness parameter of the Sobolev ball. In practice, this parameter is unknown and, hence, the optimal MMD test with this particular kernel cannot be used. To overcome this issue, we construct an aggregated test, called MMDAgg, which is adaptive to the smoothness parameter. The test power is maximised over the collection of kernels used, without requiring held-out data for kernel selection (which results in a loss of test power), or arbitrary kernel choices such as the median heuristic. We prove that MMDAgg still controls the level non-asymptotically, and achieves the minimax rate over Sobolev balls, up to an iterated logarithmic term. Our guarantees are not restricted to a specific type of kernel, but hold for any product of one-dimensional translation invariant characteristic kernels. We provide a user-friendly parameter-free implementation of MMDAgg using an adaptive collection of bandwidths. We demonstrate that MMDAgg significantly outperforms alternative state-of-the-art MMD-based two-sample tests on synthetic data satisfying the Sobolev smoothness assumption, and that, on real-world image data, MMDAgg closely matches the power of tests leveraging the use of models such as neural networks.},

abstract = {A learning method is self-certified if it uses all available data to simultaneously learn a predictor and certify its quality with a statistical certificate that is valid on unseen data. Recent work has shown that neural network models trained by optimising PAC-Bayes bounds lead not only to accurate predictors, but also to tight risk certificates, bearing promise towards achieving self-certified learning. In this context, learning and certification strategies based on PAC-Bayes bounds are especially attractive due to their ability to leverage all data to learn a posterior and simultaneously certify its risk. In this paper, we assess the progress towards self-certification in probabilistic neural networks learnt by PAC-Bayes inspired objectives. We empirically compare (on 4 classification datasets) classical test set bounds for deterministic predictors and a PAC-Bayes bound for randomised self-certified predictors. We first show that both of these generalisation bounds are not too far from out-of-sample test set errors. We then show that in data starvation regimes, holding out data for the test set bounds adversely affects generalisation performance, while self-certified strategies based on PAC-Bayes bounds do not suffer from this drawback, proving that they might be a suitable choice for the small data regime. We also find that probabilistic neural networks learnt by PAC-Bayes inspired objectives lead to certificates that can be surprisingly competitive with commonly used test set bounds.},

KSDAgg avoids splitting the data to perform kernel selection (which leads to a loss in test power), and rather maximises the test power over a collection of kernels. We provide theoretical guarantees on the power of KSDAgg: we show it achieves the smallest uniform separation rate of the collection, up to a logarithmic term. KSDAgg can be computed exactly in practice as it relies either on a parametric bootstrap or on a wild bootstrap to estimate the quantiles and the level corrections. In particular, for the crucial choice of bandwidth of a fixed kernel, it avoids resorting to arbitrary heuristics (such as median or standard deviation) or to data splitting. We find on both synthetic and real-world data that KSDAgg outperforms other state-of-the-art adaptive KSD-based goodness-of-fit testing procedures.},

note = "Submitted.",
abstract = {Current PAC-Bayes generalisation bounds are restricted to scalar metrics of performance, such as the loss or error rate. However, one ideally wants more information-rich certificates that control the entire distribution of possible outcomes, such as the distribution of the test loss in regression, or the probabilities of different mis-classifications. We provide the first PAC-Bayes bound capable of providing such rich information by bounding the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the empirical and true probabilities of a set of $M$ error types, which can either be discretized loss values for regression, or the elements of the confusion matrix (or a partition thereof) for classification. We transform our bound into a differentiable training objective. Our bound is especially useful in cases where the severity of different mis-classifications may change over time; existing PAC-Bayes bounds can only bound a particular pre-decided weighting of the error types. In contrast our bound implicitly controls all uncountably many weightings simultaneously.},

abstract = {Online social networks have become primary means of communication. As they often exhibit undesirable effects such as hostility, polarisation or echo chambers, it is crucial to develop analytical tools that help us better understand them. In this paper, we are interested in the evolution of discord in social networks. Formally, we introduce a method to calculate the probability of discord between any two agents in the multi-state voter model with and without zealots. Our work applies to any directed, weighted graph with any finite number of possible opinions, allows for various update rates across agents, and does not imply any approximation. Under certain topological conditions, their opinions are independent and the joint distribution can be decoupled. Otherwise, the evolution of discord probabilities is described by a linear system of ordinary differential equations. We prove the existence of a unique equilibrium solution, which can be computed via an iterative algorithm. The classical definition of active links density is generalized to take into account long-range, weighted interactions. We illustrate our findings on real-life and synthetic networks. In particular, we investigate the impact of clustering on discord, and uncover a rich landscape of varied behaviors in polarised networks. This sheds lights on the evolution of discord between, and within, antagonistic communities.},

abstract = {Data scarcity and data imbalance have attracted a lot of attention in many fields. Data augmentation, explored as an effective approach to tackle them, can improve the robustness and efficiency of classification models by generating new samples. This paper presents REPRINT, a simple and effective hidden-space data augmentation method for imbalanced data classification. Given hidden-space representations of samples in each class, REPRINT extrapolates, in a randomized fashion, augmented examples for target class by using subspaces spanned by principal components to summarize distribution structure of both source and target class. Consequently, the examples generated would diversify the target while maintaining the original geometry of target distribution. Besides, this method involves a label refinement component which allows to synthesize new soft labels for augmented examples. Compared with different NLP data augmentation approaches under a range of data imbalanced scenarios on four text classification benchmark, REPRINT shows prominent improvements. Moreover, through comprehensive ablation studies, we show that label refinement is better than label-preserving for augmented examples, and that our method suggests stable and consistent improvements in terms of suitable choices of principal components. Moreover, REPRINT is appealing for its easy-to-use since it contains only one hyperparameter determining the dimension of subspace and requires low computational resource.},

abstract = {We propose a series of computationally efficient, nonparametric tests for the two-sample, independence and goodness-of-fit problems, using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), and Kernel Stein Discrepancy (KSD), respectively. Our test statistics are incomplete $U$-statistics, with a computational cost that interpolates between linear time in the number of samples, and quadratic time, as associated with classical $U$-statistic tests. The three proposed tests aggregate over several kernel bandwidths to detect departures from the null on various scales: we call the resulting tests MMDAggInc, HSICAggInc and KSDAggInc. For the test thresholds, we derive a quantile bound for wild bootstrapped incomplete $U$-statistics, which is of independent interest. We derive uniform separation rates for MMDAggInc and HSICAggInc, and quantify exactly the trade-off between computational efficiency and the attainable rates: this result is novel for tests based on incomplete $U$-statistics, to our knowledge. We further show that in the quadratic-time case, the wild bootstrap incurs no penalty to test power over more widespread permutation-based approaches, since both attain the same minimax optimal rates (which in turn match the rates that use oracle quantiles). We support our claims with numerical experiments on the trade-off between computational efficiency and test power. In the three testing frameworks, we observe that our proposed linear-time aggregated tests obtain higher power than current state-of-the-art linear-time kernel tests.},

These clusters of like-minded individuals tend to reinforce prior beliefs, elicit animosity towards others and aggravate the spread of misinformation. We study this phenomenon on a Twitter dataset related to the 2017 French presidential elections and propose a method to tackle it with content recommendations. We use a quadratic program to find optimal recommendations that maximise the diversity of content users are exposed to, while still accounting for their preferences. Our method relies on a theoretical model that can sufficiently describe how content flows through the platform. We show that the model provides good approximations of empirical measures and demonstrate the effectiveness of the optimisation algorithm at mitigating the echo chamber effect on this dataset, even with limited budget for recommendations.},

abstract = {Minimising upper bounds on the population risk or the generalisation gap has been widely used in structural risk minimisation (SRM) - this is in particular at the core of PAC-Bayesian learning. Despite its successes and unfailing surge of interest in recent years, a limitation of the PAC-Bayesian framework is that most bounds involve a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term (or its variations), which might exhibit erratic behavior and fail to capture the underlying geometric structure of the learning problem - hence restricting its use in practical applications. As a remedy, recent studies have attempted to replace the KL divergence in the PAC-Bayesian bounds with the Wasserstein distance. Even though these bounds alleviated the aforementioned issues to a certain extent, they either hold in expectation, are for bounded losses, or are nontrivial to minimize in an SRM framework. In this work, we contribute to this line of research and prove novel Wasserstein distance-based PAC-Bayesian generalisation bounds for both batch learning with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data, and online learning with potentially non-i.i.d. data. Contrary to previous art, our bounds are stronger in the sense that (i) they hold with high probability, (ii) they apply to unbounded (potentially heavy-tailed) losses, and (iii) they lead to optimizable training objectives that can be used in SRM. As a result we derive novel Wasserstein-based PAC-Bayesian learning algorithms and we illustrate their empirical advantage on a variety of experiments.},

author={Fredrik Hellström and Giuseppe Durisi and Benjamin Guedj and Maxim Raginsky},
year={2023},
note = "Submitted.",
abstract = {A fundamental question in theoretical machine learning is generalization. Over the past decades, the PAC-Bayesian approach has been established as a flexible framework to address the generalization capabilities of machine learning algorithms, and design new ones. Recently, it has garnered increased interest due to its potential applicability for a variety of learning algorithms, including deep neural networks. In parallel, an information-theoretic view of generalization has developed, wherein the relation between generalization and various information measures has been established. This framework is intimately connected to the PAC-Bayesian approach, and a number of results have been independently discovered in both strands. In this monograph, we highlight this strong connection and present a unified treatment of generalization. We present techniques and results that the two perspectives have in common, and discuss the approaches and interpretations that differ. In particular, we demonstrate how many proofs in the area share a modular structure, through which the underlying ideas can be intuited. We pay special attention to the conditional mutual information (CMI) framework; analytical studies of the information complexity of learning algorithms; and the application of the proposed methods to deep learning. This monograph is intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to information-theoretic generalization bounds and their connection to PAC-Bayes, serving as a foundation from which the most recent developments are accessible. It is aimed broadly towards researchers with an interest in generalization and theoretical machine learning.},

The bounds hold under the assumption that the cumulant-generating function (CGF) of the comparator is upper-bounded by the corresponding CGF within a family of bounding distributions. We show that the tightest possible bound is obtained with the comparator being the convex conjugate of the CGF of the bounding distribution, also known as the Cram\'er function. This conclusion applies more broadly to generalization bounds with a similar structure. This confirms the near-optimality of known bounds for bounded and sub-Gaussian losses and leads to novel bounds under other bounding distributions.},

We then build a global randomised predictor which inherits the properties of the local private predictors in the sense of a PAC-Bayesian generalisation bound. We consider the synchronous case where all nodes share the same training objective (derived from a generalisation bound), and the asynchronous case where each node may have its own personalised training objective. We show through a series of numerical experiments that our approach achieves a comparable predictive performance to that of the batch approach where all datasets are shared across nodes. Moreover the predictors are supported by numerically nonvacuous generalisation bounds while preserving privacy for each node. We explicitly compute the increment on predictive performance and generalisation bounds between batch and federated settings, highlighting the price to pay to preserve privacy.},

A benchmark against three existing methods (Fisher’s information, bootstrapping and Beale’s criteria) was conducted using synthetic data. This Bayesian procedure offered a good compromise between fitting ability and confidence estimation, while the other methods proved to be repeatedly overconfident. The method’s performances notably benefitted from inductive bias brought by the prior distribution, although it requires careful construction. This article advocates for more systematic consideration of uncertainty for anaerobic digestion models and showcases a new, computationally efficient Bayesian method.

In this work, we propose a new class of filters based on Gaussian PSD Models, which offer several advantages in terms of density approximation and computational efficiency. We show that filtering can be efficiently performed in closed form when transitions and observations are Gaussian PSD Models. When the transition and observations are approximated by Gaussian PSD Models, we show that our proposed estimator enjoys strong theoretical guarantees, with estimation error that depends on the quality of the approximation and is adaptive to the regularity of the transition probabilities.  In particular, we identify regimes in which our proposed filter attains a TV $\epsilon$-error with memory and computational complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-1})$ and $O(\epsilon^{-3/2})$ respectively, including the offline learning step, in contrast to the $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ complexity of sampling methods such as particle filtering.},
